<p>We hope you will enjoy your stay in Williamsburg. This
is the only historically important town in America which has
changed so little in two hundred years.</p>
<p>We who live in Williamsburg love it. We hope you will
stay long enough to get sentimental over it, too.</p>
<p>To help you get the most out of your visit we offer the
following suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Williamsburg is not a museum. It is a living community.</p>
<p>2. The chief value of Williamsburg is its atmosphere.
But for our having a few automobiles and new-fangled
clothes, there has been mighty little change in this atmosphere
since Thomas Jefferson and George Washington helped
to make it what it is.</p>
<p>3. If you come from New York or Chicago don&rsquo;t think
of going inside any ancient building until you have spent at
least one day in getting calmed down to our tempo and
learning to wander about instead of hustling. Get into the
spirit of the place.</p>
<p>4. Then, when you begin to feel at home and wish to
see some interiors, take it easy. Go to the Church one day,
the Palace another day, and so on. Imagine <i>rushing</i> through
the Governor&rsquo;s Garden!</p>

<h3 id="c3">MIDDLE PLANTATION.</h3>
<p>After the settlement of Jamestown in 1607 the population
of the Virginia Colony gradually spread out from that
center until, in 1633, it became desirable to develop farms in
the territory between the James and York Rivers, which has
ever since been called the Virginia Peninsula. From its
position in relation to the rivers, this settlement was named
Middle Plantation.</p>
<p>The privilege of dwelling in this district was granted by
the colonial legislature on condition that a <span class="sc">Palisade</span> be
erected to keep out the Indians. This palisade extended from
Queen&rsquo;s Creek, which empties into the York River, to
Archer&rsquo;s Hope Creek (now called College Creek), which is
a tributary of the James. This palisade was kept in repair
until 1710.</p>
<p>At present, only two buildings remain which were here
in the 17th century: the Galt House on Francis Street and
the main building of the College.</p>
<h3 id="c4">THE COLLEGE.</h3>
<p>The first attempt to found a college in America had its
inception at Jamestown in 1617. Land was secured near the
present site of Richmond and considerable endowment was
invested in farm stock. Before operation of the college could
begin, the whole undertaking was wiped out by the great
Indian massacre of 1622. Two generations later a group of
important citizens met at the house of Col. Page to make
plans for an institution which would make advanced education
possible without the necessity of going to England.
As a result of this meeting action was secured from the
colonial legislature and Rev. James Blair was sent to
London to request a charter and financial assistance from
King William and Queen Mary. Not only was he successful
in his main object but, at the same time, he got Sir
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Christopher Wren to draw plans for a building which
should be worthy of the College of William and Mary in
Virginia. This central structure of the College, generally
known as <span class="sc">The Wren Building</span>, was designed in the form
of a quadrangle; the easterly side was constructed in 1695,
the northerly and westerly wings shortly thereafter; the
fourth side of the quadrangle has never been built.</p>

<p>Few students in the America of today have a more magnificent
inspirational background than those who attend classes
in the Wren Building. Probably nowhere else did so many
of the real founders of our government get their education
and inspiration in the same rooms. In one manner or another
there have been associated with William and Mary, Presidents
Washington, Jefferson, Monroe and (in the next
generation) Tyler, as well as jurists and statesmen of the
most beneficent influence. And great teachers there were,
too. Thomas Jefferson testified that it was from Professor
Small that he received the inspiration for his life work.
Bishop Madison, the first president under the Commonwealth,
was a really great teacher of Natural Phylosophy, as
were Patrick Rogers and his famous son.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="pcap">THE CAPITOL</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">Dr. Blair</span> was a truly remarkable man. While in London
he wrote back that he had secured the necessary teachers for
the College but that he could not find anyone adequate for
the presidency; but, he added, perhaps he would do pretty
well, himself, in that position; and so it came about. It is
perfectly clear that he was one of the leading citizens of
Virginia. He was simultaneously Commissary of the Bishop
of London (the highest ecclesiastical office in the Colony),
Rector of Bruton Parish, President of the College, member
of the Governor&rsquo;s Council and thereby a judge in the highest
court in Virginia. He was a man of very firm character,
usually in a serious controversy with some important opponent;
as a result, he secured the cashiering of three Royal
Governors. One of these contests throws interesting light
on academic customs, there being an annual &ldquo;lock-out day&rdquo;
at the College. On one of these celebrations (the immediate
object being the securing of a longer Christmas recess), the
boys being inside the Wren Building and having nailed the
doors to prevent entrance by any faculty members, President
Blair superintended the forcing open of a door. During the
scuffle he received the contents of a gun in his shoulder,
after which he sent formal complaint to the authorities in
London charging that the Governor of the Colony had
armed the pupils for an attack on their president. For
months thereafter criminations and recriminations traveled
across the Atlantic. The Governor swore that he lent the
students only the gun and powder, no bullets whatever. It
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
became apparent that what hit the President&rsquo;s shoulder was
only the paper which was used to ram in the powder. Nevertheless,
Governor Spotswood left and Dr. Blair remained.</p>

<h3 id="c5">WILLIAMSBURG.</h3>
<p>Shortly after the College began to function, a fire at
Jamestown destroyed the government building. As that location
was quite malarial, it was deemed best to establish a new
capital on higher ground and it was decided to locate it near
the College at Middle Plantation. Legislation was enacted
setting off for such purpose approximately what is now
known as The Restoration Area, together with approaches
through Capitol Landing Road from Queen Mary&rsquo;s Port
on Queen&rsquo;s Creek and through South Henry Street from
Princess Anne Port on Archer&rsquo;s Hope Creek. Since the
receipt of the College charter in 1693, Queen Mary had died,
leaving William III to reign alone; so the newly planned
city was called Williamsburg.</p>
<p>This, the second planned city in America, was laid out in
1699 with the main street named for Princess Anne&rsquo;s son,
<span class="sc">Duke of Gloucester Street</span>. The center line of the
street was laid out from the middle of the doorway of the
Wren Building in an easterly direction so far as to make
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
the whole length of the street exactly three-fourths of a mile
long. The street&rsquo;s width was fixed at six poles (99 feet)
and all buildings were to be kept back six feet from the
street. Governor Nicholson named two of the streets for
himself: Francis and Nicholson. Other streets had such
significant names as England, Ireland, Scotland, France,
Nassau, Prince George and York. Williamsburg being on
the crest of the York and James watersheds, there were
many brooks or dry ravines crossing all the east-west streets.
For years Duke of Gloucester Street spanned these ravines
on bridges.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE RALEIGH TAVERN</p>
</div>
<p>The first public building to be erected after the laying
out of the city was, naturally, <span class="sc">The Capitol</span>. This was
located on the easterly extension of the center line of Duke
of Gloucester Street, thus balancing the Wren Building on
the west. Until the completion of the Capitol, the General
Assembly held its meetings in the Blue Room of the Wren
Building. After the completion of the Capitol it became
for three-quarters of a century, the center of public activity
in the Virginia Colony, the training-school of democracy,
the place where Americans contended against autocracy.
Here Patrick Henry made his famous &ldquo;Caesar-Brutus&rdquo;
speech; here George Washington received the thanks of the
Colony; here Thomas Jefferson secured religious freedom
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
for his State; here George Mason presented the first Bill of
Rights. The rooms in this building are indeed hallowed for
every lover of liberty!</p>

<p class="pcap">BLAND-WETHERBURN TAVERN</p>
</div>
<p>Repeatedly, when the Royal Governor felt obliged to
prorogue the Assembly for impertinence to the King, the
entire membership withdrew to <span class="sc">The Raleigh Tavern</span>
where rump sessions were held. In such gatherings, and in
frequent less formal meetings at this famous tavern, many
important decisions were reached in the growing contest
between the Crown and its colonial subjects. This tavern
appears to have been the most important informal social
center in Virginia in the later years of the 18th century.
In the earlier years of that century, certainly as early as
1709, this service was performed by the <span class="sc">Bland-Wetherburn
Tavern</span>, directly across the street. This is the third
oldest building now standing in Williamsburg. It was probably
built by Richard Bland, Sr., about the year 1700 and
was a meeting place for leading citizens after the completion
of the Capitol. At various times the famous host, Henry
Wetherburn, ran this hostelry and the Raleigh, opposite.</p>
<p>As Solomon did not build a house for himself until he
had completed the Temple, so the colonial Virginians
finished the building of the Capitol before beginning, in
1706, a residence for the Royal Governor. Like most great
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
houses of the period, <span class="sc">The Governor&rsquo;s Palace</span> was not
built all at once. In 1706, &pound;3,000 was appropriated for the
erection of a &ldquo;house&rdquo; for the Governor. What with additions
and furnishings, by 1718 it had become a &ldquo;palace&rdquo;
and the House of Burgesses was complaining of the high-handed
manner in which the Governor was &ldquo;lavishing away
the country&rsquo;s money contrary to the intent of the law.&rdquo; As
in the case of many another public building, the extravagance
of construction cost was forgotten by later generations in
their pride in the product. A traveled Englishman considered
this the finest building in America and exceeded by few in
England, an opinion which has never required revision.
From its completion, it was occupied by all the Royal
Governors down to the Revolutionary War; and then by
two Governors of the Commonwealth, Patrick Henry and
Thomas Jefferson. After the removal of the Capital to
Richmond in 1779, the Palace was used by the army as a
hospital.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE GOVERNOR&rsquo;S PALACE</p>
</div>
<p>After providing a residence for the Governor, the next
public building erected by order of the Assembly was a
Public Magazine, familiarly called <span class="sc">The Powder Horn</span>.
From 1714 to 1775 this octagonal brick structure was used
for the storage of ammunition; and for reasons of safety it
was placed in an open square. This building saw the beginning
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of the Revolutionary War, so far as Virginia was
concerned. On the 20th of April, 1775, just one day after
the Battle of Lexington, in Massachusetts, Governor Dunmore
removed the powder so that it might not fall into the
hands of the populace. Thereupon, Patrick Henry brought
troops toward Williamsburg and secured the payment of
&pound;330 from the King&rsquo;s Receiver General, with which substitute
powder was purchased. The Governor withdrew to the
comparative safety of a British warship and thus ended
forever foreign dominance in Williamsburg.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE POWDER HORN</p>
</div>
<p>While the Public Magazine was under construction the
Colony and the Parish were proceeding with the erection of
a fine new building to take the place of the antiquated
structure of <span class="sc">The Bruton Parish Church</span>. The then-existing
building, whose foundations are still in place under
the sod of the churchyard, was adequate only for a small
rural community. With the influx of large numbers of
people for court seasons and with the necessity for dignity, if
not grandeur, in the edifice of the Established Church of
the Colonial Capital, the Governor, the Assembly and the
Parish united in building a church which, from its completion
in 1715 to the present time, has been one of the prides
of Virginia, whether Colony or Commonwealth.</p>

<p class="pcap">BRUTON PARISH CHURCH</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>It will probably be impossible for one to understand the
helpful leadership of this church in the ecclesiastical life of
Virginia without an appreciation of the great difficulty experienced
in securing high-grade, or even fairly respectable,
clergy in the country districts. In all church affairs Virginia
was directly under the control of the Bishop of London.
It is evident from the records that great pressure must have
been exerted on him to send to Virginia the ne&rsquo;er-do-well
younger sons of British aristocrats or any other low-grade
men who had been trained for the church as for any other
occupation and who had at all costs to be got out of England.
Governor Gooch, one of the best Royal Governors Virginia
ever had, was active throughout his long and happy administration
in raising the ministerial standards; it is impossible to
read his letters to the Bishop of London without having the
greatest sympathy for him in his Augean labors. Through all
this sad experience, with the exception of the reported indictment
of Dr. Dawson for drunkenness in 1760, Bruton Parish
seems to have been blessed with such leadership as helped
much to raise the whole colonial standard.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE TRAVIS HOUSE</p>
</div>
<p>It is somewhat difficult in this generation to realize the
unity of church with state in Colonial Virginia when the
legislature might order sermons on special subjects. A most
notable case was the setting apart by the Assembly of June 1,
1774, the day when the British were forcibly to close the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
Port of Boston, as a day of fasting and prayer. The enactment
closed with these words: &ldquo;Ordered, that the members
of this house do attend in their Places, at the Hour of ten
in the Forenoon, on the said first Day of June next, in order
to proceed with the Speaker, and the Mace, to the Church
in this City, for the Purposes aforesaid; and that the
Reverend Mr. Price be appointed to read Prayers, and the
Reverend Mr. Gwatkin, to preach a Sermon, suitable to
the Occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c6">THE RESTORATION.</h3>
<p>During the first tenure of Rev. W. A. R. Goodwin
as Rector of Bruton Parish, in 1905, the restoration of the
church building to its early condition was begun. While no
great alteration had ever been made to its exterior, the
interior arrangements had been modified to such an extent as
to make it scarcely recognizable. The entire arrangement,
both within and without, was now returned, as nearly as
available information permitted, to its condition after an
enlargement that had been made in 1751.</p>
<p>During his second incumbency in Williamsburg, Dr.
Goodwin became increasingly impressed with the possibility
of preserving this old capital city as it was in its first period
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
of importance. Only a few other cities in America had the
importance of Williamsburg in the founding of our nation;
and the others&mdash;Boston and Philadelphia&mdash;had long since
been swallowed up in great commercial cities. Williamsburg,
on the other hand, had remained for two hundred years very
much the same both in spirit and in physical appearance.
Through the years it had continued as the county-seat of an
agricultural county and the trading center of another similar
one; no industries, no skyscrapers, no conflagrations had
changed it. To be sure, a few modern buildings would have to
be removed and a considerable number of ancient ones rebuilt.
But, at that, it remained the only center of colonial political
importance where a thorough restoration was thinkable.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="462" />
<p class="pcap">HOME OF ROBERT CARTER NICHOLAS</p>
</div>
<p>In connection with meetings of the Phi Beta Kappa
Society, Dr. Goodwin convinced Mr. John D. Rockefeller,
Jr., of the soundness of his views in this regard and studied
the situation with him in its broad features. The following
year (1927) Mr. Rockefeller definitely determined to undertake,
with the co&ouml;peration of the City, the restoration of the
ancient part of Williamsburg to its condition as of mid-18th
century&mdash;an undertaking which is probably the greatest
educational accomplishment of the present century.</p>
<p>The restoration is not yet completed and it is unlikely
that further construction will be possible during the war.
It may be roughly estimated as within eighty or ninety
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
percent of completion. The First Theater in America is the
outstanding public building not yet reconstructed; the number
of residences still awaiting attention is indefinite but not
large.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p06a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="464" />
<p class="pcap">BASSETT HALL</p>
</div>
<p>Not far from half the buildings now standing in the old
part of the city are the identical buildings which have lasted
through from pre-Revolutionary days. These buildings have
been thoroughly repaired, any modern additions removed and
their grounds planted with such trees and flowers as probably
were there in the 18th century. These buildings are
technically described as &ldquo;restored&rdquo; in distinction from those
which had been destroyed and are &ldquo;reconstructed.&rdquo; A comparison
of each restored building with its condition just
before restoration would be interesting. The principal case
available is that of the Cole Shop in which hangs an oil
painting loaned by Mrs. Rockefeller and showing the interior
of the shop in 1938 in contrast with its present condition
which is supposed to be as it was in 1780.</p>
<p>The most apparent change resulting from the restoration
is that of <span class="sc">Duke of Gloucester Street</span> itself. Prior to its
restoration in 1935 there were two concrete roadways separated
by a strip of grass in which were unpainted wooden
poles carrying electric wires. The restoration of the street
illustrates very well the type of compromises which have
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
been necessary in order to keep Williamsburg an up-to-date
community as it distinctly was in its first century. Thus,
while the wires have been buried, the street has not been
returned to its former condition of six inches of mud or
dust according to the weather; but it has been finished with
a hard surface nearly resembling gravel. The town has not
reverted to flambeaux for the wealthy and darkness for the
poor; but the electric street lights are as old-fashioned as
possible. Most nearly impossible of all problems was that
of fire prevention; it was solved by installing the least conspicuous
hydrants in the grass and painting them green.</p>

<p class="pcap">GEORGE WYTHE HOUSE</p>
</div>
<p>The first buildings to be restored were those of <span class="sc">The
College</span>. The original building had suffered from three
fires. These gave excuse for adding the beautiful wings,
housing the Chapel and the Great Hall, but also gave opportunity
for departure from the plans of Sir Christopher
Wren; so that the architects estimate that the building as we
know it (and as it was just before the Revolution) is about
50 percent Wren and 50 percent local adjustment. The cost
of the third fire, which occurred while the building was in the
hands of Northern troops, was reimbursed from the Federal
Treasury on motion of Senator Hoar of Massachusetts.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">The Botetourt Statue</span> in the front campus has had a
notable history. Lord Botetourt was the Royal Governor
who had repeatedly to prorogue the Assembly for action
inimical to the Crown. Nevertheless, the people of Virginia
respected him deeply for his personal qualities and for his
sincerely democratic sentiments, realizing that his public
actions were such as he was obliged to take regardless of
his sympathies. So, after his death in 1770, the Assembly
had this statue made in London by Sculptor Richard Hayward.
The statue was erected in the open corridor of the
Capitol; but during the Revolutionary War feeling against
all that was English ran so high that some of the 100 percent
disloyalists threw it to the ground, with casualties that still
are to be seen. When the excitement somewhat calmed, and
after the Capitol had been abandoned as the seat of government,
the Botetourt statue was set up in the College campus,
somewhat nearer the building than at present. During the
War Between the States the statue found refuge with the
Eastern State Hospital, thereafter being brought back to its
present location. Lord Botetourt&rsquo;s body is entombed in the
College Chapel.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="sc">The President&rsquo;s House</span> on the right as one faces the
Wren Building and <span class="sc">The Brafferton</span> on the left, both date
from early 18th century. The latter was originally a school
for Indian boys and was supported by funds from the estate
of the eminent chemist, Robert Boyle. In the 19th century,
when it was no longer used by Indians, it became a home for
faculty members, notably Patrick Kerr Rogers and his son
William Barton Rogers who later founded the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. The Brafferton is one of
the ancient buildings which has no record of a damaging fire.
The President&rsquo;s House was burned while it was being used
by the French army and was restored by King Louis XVI.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Palace</span>, after the Capital was removed to Richmond,
was transferred to the Army for use as a hospital,
during which occupancy it was accidentally destroyed by fire.
The southerly frontage of this property was later used for
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
the city&rsquo;s public school. In order to return the entire site to
its original condition, as called for by the restoration program,
a modern school building has been erected just west
of the Palace grounds; also the railroad tracks, which ran
through the Governor&rsquo;s Garden area, have been relocated
to the north; and the entire garden as well as the Palace
itself has been reconstructed. The extremely interesting
research which underlies the entire restoration is well illustrated
in the case of the Palace. Information regarding the
design and construction of the building was obtained in such
diverse places as the Huntington Library in Pasadena, California,
and the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England.
Fortunately, the original foundations were still in good
condition.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE COKE-GARRETT HOUSE</p>

<p>The restoration of <span class="sc">The Capitol</span> was facilitated by the
fact that the colonial legislature, in ordering its erection,
determined the design down to details not only of building
but of furnishing. The building itself, after various vicissitudes,
was destroyed by fire in 1832. The foundations were
covered over and preserved by a patriotic group of women
who devoted themselves to saving important historical monuments,
the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities.
When the restoration of Williamsburg was undertaken,
they presented this site to the Restoration organization.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE COURT HOUSE OF 1770</p>
</div>
<p>Another ancient building which had been preserved (and
is still owned) by the A. P. V. A. is <span class="sc">The Powder Horn</span>,
more formally known as The Public Magazine. After the
Revolutionary War this building was used for a variety of
purposes, including religious worship, at which time stained
glass windows were installed. When the Baptist Church
became strong enough to build their own edifice just to the
east of the Magazine, they tore down the surrounding wall
and used the bricks for the foundation of the new church.
This congregation has now removed to a newer part of the
town and the Powder Horn has been restored to its original
condition. In this building is a collection of Revolutionary
arms.</p>
<p>Across the road from the Powder Horn is <span class="sc">The Court
House of 1770</span>. This is now commonly called &ldquo;the Old
Court House&rdquo; since the location of the still older seat of
city and county government (in the rear of the Powder
Horn) has been used for the present modern Court House.
The Restoration of the Old Court House illustrates one of
the guiding policies of the restoration which is to perpetuate
the old part of Williamsburg as it was in the 18th century,
by no means with the object of beautifying it. In 1910 the
Old Court House was consumed by fire except as to the
exterior walls. In rebuilding, the structure was distinctly
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
improved in appearance by addition of columns to support
the piazza roof; in its restoration the columns were omitted,
thus securing authenticity at the expense of beauty. The
intention has been to keep to this policy of authenticity
throughout the restoration; it will be noticed, for example,
that the planting in restored gardens is of 18th century
plants, though in many cases modern culture has improved
the species. Within the Old Court House may be seen a
selection from the many tons of artifacts which have been
recovered in the course of excavations about the ancient
buildings.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE PUBLIC GAOL</p>

<p>As early as 1701, while meeting in the Wren Building, the
Virginia Assembly enacted legislation specifying details not
only for the Capitol but also for a <span class="sc">Gaol</span> (pronounced gail,
not goal) to be erected on the north side of the square
which was reserved for these buildings and the office of the
Secretary of the Colony. Parts of the Gaol were torn down
after the removal of the state court to Richmond, for
Williamsburg has always been quite law-abiding. The portions
thus destroyed have now been re-added to the surviving
building, as also the stocks and pillory outside the wall.
So the whole may now be seen as it stood when Blackbeard&rsquo;s
men were imprisoned and hanged here.</p>
<p>The final restoration of <span class="sc">Bruton Parish Church</span> was
made during the last days of Dr. Goodwin and he was able
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
to visit it during all but the last stages. At the first service
held in the completed edifice his body was buried beneath
the floor of the church by the side of great men of colonial
times. It has been suggested that an appropriate epitaph,
referring not alone to the church but to the community,
would be: If you would see his monument, look about you.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE COLE SHOP</p>
</div>
<p><span class="sc">The Cole Shop</span> <a href="#map1">(D)</a> is believed to be the oldest store
in America, having opened for business shortly after 1750.
It was built by Charles Taliaferro, a coach and chair
maker. Originally consisting of only one room, prior to
1782 another small building was moved up and joined to it
on the west as a sort of lean-to, the roof-line which had
theretofore been a symmetrical dormer being extended to
cover the addition. At a later, but still early, date two rooms
were added in the rear and the street elevation was finished
off with a false front. In 1804 the shop was sold to Dr. Jesse
Cole in whose family it remained until the death of his
grandson in 1936.</p>
<p>There is no record of the type of goods carried under the
Taliaferro management; but in 1827 a professor newly
arrived in Williamsburg wrote thus of the Cole Shop: &ldquo;I
reached the Post Office which stands in the Center of Main
St. It is one of the Curiosities of this Place.... There is
not an Article whatever in the World which could not be
found in it. It is a Book Seller&rsquo;s Store in which you will
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
find Hams and French Brandy; it is an Apothecary&rsquo;s Shop
in which you can provide yourself with silk Stockings and
shell Oysters; it is a Post Office in which you may have
Glisters and chewing Tobacco &amp; in a Word it is a Museum
of natural History in which we meet every Afternoon to
dispute about the Presidential Election and about the
Quality of Irish Potatoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The discussion group referred to by Prof. De La Pena
was the famous Pulaski Club which moves its sessions from
indoors to the benches outside in favorable weather. George
Washington, in his diary, refers repeatedly to attending the
club at Mrs. Campbell&rsquo;s Tavern (near the Capitol) but in
modern times the meeting place has been at the Cole Shop.
This is claimed to be the oldest men&rsquo;s social club in the
country; and whatever may be the members&rsquo; effect on the
quality of Irish potatoes, they have effectively &ldquo;saved the
country&rdquo; for a long time.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Le Maison des Foux</span> (Eastern State Hospital for the
Insane, to you), of which Dr. Jesse Cole was the Superintendent
was founded by the Colony in 1769. It is on the
site of the Custis estate where Martha Dandridge lived with
her first husband. The only Custis building still standing is
the small brick house which can be seen over the fence from
Francis Street. This is generally known as &ldquo;Martha Washington&rsquo;s
Kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>The <i>Virginia Gazette</i> office <a href="#map1">(L)</a> has not yet been reconstructed.
The <i>Gazette</i>, which is now published on Prince
George Street, is the oldest newspaper in the South, having
been established in 1736. It probably also operated the Post
Office in the early days of that institution.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Ludwell-Paradise House</span> <a href="#map1">(M)</a> now houses Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller&rsquo;s collection of American Folk Art,
ranging from cigar store Indians to oil paintings. This
house was owned and occupied in the early years of the 19th
century by Mrs. Lucy Ludwell Paradise, daughter and
granddaughter of two Ludwells who owned this and many
other Virginia estates, including Green Spring. She and her
husband held the unique distinction of maintaining their
home in London as the social center of American sympathizers
during the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p><span class="sc">George Wythe&rsquo;s House</span> <a href="#map1">(N)</a> was erected in 1755 and
has suffered remarkably little change in the intervening
years. The outbuildings were destroyed and have been reconstructed
and the restored house has been furnished throughout
with genuine 18th century furniture. Aside from the
Palace, this is the only restored residence which is open to
public inspection, all others being occupied as private homes,
many of them by descendants of the original owners. George
Wythe was a very substantial citizen of the late colonial and
early republican period. He was a Signer of the Declaration
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
of Independence and, as first law professor in America,
instructed such leaders of democracy as Thomas Jefferson,
James Monroe, John Marshall and St. George Tucker.</p>
<p>The Carter-Saunders House, <span class="sc">The Home of Robert
Carter Nicholas</span> <a href="#map1">(P)</a>, Treasurer of the Colony, being a
fine house next to the Governor&rsquo;s Palace, was close to the
social center of the capital city and was always occupied by
socially prominent citizens including more than one of the
mighty Carters and by the Governor himself when his own
residence was undergoing repairs. There is a fine garden
which can be seen from the walk that connects Palace Green
with West Scotland Street.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The First Theater in America</span> <a href="#map1">(Q)</a> has not yet been
reconstructed but its location is marked on the ground. Some
of the great English actors of that day came to play in this
house and the social setting was gala indeed. As cited in a
little book, <i>The Sports of Colonial Williamsburg</i>, Shakespeare,
Addison, Steele, Ciber and Garrick were favorite
authors in Colonial Williamsburg. This theater is the scene
of Mary Johnston&rsquo;s book, Audrey. The heroine was portrayed
as an actress in this theater and as living in the
delightful old house between the Theater and the Palace,
which is therefore often called &ldquo;the Audrey House&rdquo; or <span class="sc">The
Brush-Audrey House</span>, it having been built in 1718 by
John Brush, armorer and gunsmith to the Governor and
keeper of the Powder Magazine. In the rear of the Audrey
House and the theater site is the oldest growth of box in
Williamsburg; this should be approached from Scotland
Street as the southerly portion of this box garden is so overgrown
that it has been necessary to close it.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The St. George Tucker House</span> <a href="#map1">(R)</a>, one of the most
beautiful in Williamsburg, was ancient in its beginning and
was enlarged to its present dimensions just after the Revolutionary
War by St. George Tucker who came from Bermuda
to study law under George Wythe and later succeeded him
as law teacher and author. The house is now occupied by
one of his descendants.</p>
<p><span class="sc">The Randolph House</span> <a href="#map1">(S)</a> was owned in 1742 by Sir
John Randolph, the only native of Virginia to be knighted.
This house was the residence of Gen. Rochambeau prior to
the Battle of Yorktown and probably during the two years
of waiting for the Treaty of Paris. Here, also, Lafayette
was entertained on his return visit to America in 1824.</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Coke-Garrett House</span> <a href="#map1">(T)</a> was begun in 1720
and added to at later times as shown by various floor levels.
Altogether, it is one of the finest residences in Williamsburg
and has a famous old garden which is second only to that of
the Governor.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Bassett Hall</span> <a href="#map1">(V)</a>, the only Williamsburg house with
the long straight avenue approach which was so common
out in the country, was built in the middle of the 18th
century. It was at times a residence, at times a tavern. It
takes its name from Martha Washington&rsquo;s nephew who
bought it soon after the Revolutionary War. Later it was
owned by Abel P. Upshur, a member of President Tyler&rsquo;s
Cabinet and it is believed that Vice-President Tyler was
visiting here when he was notified of his succession. The
estate is now the home of Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tazewell Hall</span> <a href="#map1">(Z)</a> gets its name from an owner who
purchased it after it had been forfeited by John Randolph,
the Tory, when he fled to England at the outset of the
Revolutionary War. This John Randolph (who later returned
and was buried in the College Chapel) was the last
Attorney General under the Crown and his son, who was
born in this house, was the first Attorney General of the
United States. The house was moved to its present position
to facilitate a real-estate development to the south; it formerly
stood squarely opposite the end of South England Street.
As can be clearly seen, it has not yet been restored.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>New Williamsburg</i></span></h2>
<p>Williamsburg never grew substantially beyond the
limits defined in 1699 until the year 1900 when the boundaries
were extended at both ends of the town to take in the
development of population that occurred with the growth
of the College. Repeatedly since then enlargements have
been made, especially as the College grew during the presidency
of Dr. J. A. C. Chandler. Of late there has been
building in the Capitol Landing Road district and out
Jamestown Road; but throughout the present century the
principal growth has been along Richmond Road. Here all
the churches except Bruton have built new edifices opposite
the College. The Methodists, it is true, are just inside the
ancient city limits, at the College Corner. At the outset of
the restoration it was determined, whether wisely or not,
that the westerly block on each side of Duke of Gloucester
Street should not be restored, but developed for the convenience
of the residents. The shops in these two blocks are
designed to be in keeping with the ancient architecture but
are in no way restorations.</p>
<p>Just within the southern boundary of old Williamsburg,
the Restoration operates two modern hotels: the Williamsburg
Inn and The Lodge. The former is, during the war,
reserved for military and naval officers and their families;
the Lodge is still open to the general public. In either case,
reservations should be made in advance, especially for weekends.
Persons planning to visit Williamsburg and desiring
accommodations in private families should communicate in
advance with proprietors of guest-houses or with the Room
Registry jointly operated by the Chamber of Commerce and
the U. S. O.; and an advance deposit should be made. The
reason for this is that Williamsburg (as will be seen by the
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
map on <a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>) is a very small civilian island almost
entirely surrounded by military and naval establishments
populated by many thousands of service men whose relatives
desire to visit them. It is this situation which leads to the
uncertainty of reply when questions are asked as to the population
of Williamsburg. Including the Hospital patients,
the 1940 census showed about 4,000 residents. Up to opening
of hostilities the population is supposed to have doubled.</p>
<p>All Williamsburg churches have regular meetings at 11
o&rsquo;clock Sunday mornings; the Masons on the second Monday
evening of each month; the Rotary Club every Thursday; the
Lions on alternate Tuesdays. For information about other
of their activities it will be well to telephone as follows:</p>
